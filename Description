Salient features of this platform includes:
- Register and sign-in for both teachers and students.
- Teachers can create courses and enroll registered students in them.
- Teachers can create course-wise quizzes with mutiple-choice questions with upto four options.
- Enrolled students can give quiz in the time frame set by teachers.
- Results will be shown immediately after the quiz ends and will be emailed to both the teachers and students.
